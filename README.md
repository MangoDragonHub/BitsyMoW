# BitsyMoW

This project is small and abridged journey to the March on Washington event in 1963. The route traveled was from Alabama, to Tenessese, to New York, to landing to D.C.
Using Bitsy, you play as a bus driver and getting from point a to point b. This design choice was important because this gives context to the world around you and just make this eventful experience more leisure like.
